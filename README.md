# Photographer
Simple website, designed for a person who wants to offer their photography services. It is a simple design, adapted to all screen formats, dedicated to demonstrating the use of technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Tailwind and Typescript. For its construction, I used resources available on the web such as Tailblocks, and the official Tailwind documentation.

## Hero page
On the "Hero" page, you will find a wallpaper adapted to the service offered, a main photo of the photographer, and a text summarizing the service, as well as two main buttons for the main actions.

## Gallery
There is a Gallery section, created with links to copyright-free images, available on the Unsplash website, in which a model portfolio of photographs is shown, so that the user can see part of the work offered by the photographer.

## Pricing
At the bottom you will find a pricing section, with four main divisions in which you can see different pricing options according to the service requested. These options can be customized and adapted according to the services offered by the photographer.
